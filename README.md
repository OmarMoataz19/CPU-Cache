# Memory Cache Implementation in Haskell and Prolog

## Overview

This project contains a memory cache implementation in both Haskell and Prolog. The purpose of this project is to showcase how a simple memory cache can be implemented in two different programming languages, highlighting the differences in syntax and approach between Haskell and Prolog.

## Features

- **Memory Cache:** The cache is designed to store key-value pairs in memory.
- **Haskell Implementation:** Utilizes Haskell's functional programming paradigm.
- **Prolog Implementation:** Demonstrates the logic programming paradigm with Prolog.
